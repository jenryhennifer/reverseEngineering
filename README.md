## Installation

``` 
npm install
```
This will install:
* bcryptjs, express, express-session, mysql2, passport, passport-local, sequelize

# server.js

This file requires express and express-session to be installed through npm install. It also requires passport.js and the models folder. 

The port is called and fisrt checks for either the environment variable PORT or will default to port 8080 as a local host:
```
var PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
```
Express uses urlencoded (library parsing), json(incoming JSON request parsing), static (service to static files), and session (tracking user login status). It also initializes passport and passport sessions.

Finally, sequelize sync is used to listen to the desired port and log the port information for the user.

```
db.sequelize.sync().then(function() {
  app.listen(PORT, function() {
    console.log("==> ðŸŒŽ  Listening on port %s. Visit http://localhost:%s/ in your browser.", PORT, PORT);
  });
});
```
